## 🧾 Project Overview

The **Grocery Management System** aims to automate and optimize core grocery store activities such as:
- Inventory management 🏷️  
- Order processing and billing 💰  
- Supplier and customer tracking 👥  
- Generating sales and performance reports 📊  

The project showcases the **use of SQL for relational database design, data manipulation, and advanced analytics** through joins, aggregations, and subqueries.

## 🧱 Database Design

The database is structured into **7 interrelated tables** following **3NF normalization**:

| Table Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Products** | Stores product details, prices, and stock quantities |
| **Customers** | Contains customer profiles and order history |
| **Suppliers** | Tracks supplier information and product associations |
| **Categories** | Defines product classifications |
| **Employees** | Records employee data and order processing details |
| **Orders** | Stores transaction-level order information |
| **Order_Details** | Links orders to specific products and quantities |

Each table includes **primary and foreign key relationships**, ensuring referential integrity and efficient querying.

## 🎯 Key Objectives

1. Build a **relational database** for managing store operations efficiently.  
2. Implement **SQL queries** to extract insights on sales, customers, suppliers, and employees.  
3. Enable **data-driven decision-making** by analyzing sales and inventory patterns.  
4. Demonstrate **real-world SQL applications** using joins, subqueries, and aggregate functions.

## 🧮 Analytical SQL Queries

The project answers key business questions such as:
1. How many unique customers have placed orders?  
2. Which customers placed the highest number of orders?  
3. What is the total and average purchase value per customer?  
4. Who are the top 5 customers by total purchase amount?  
5. What is the total revenue generated by each product and category?  
6. Which supplier provides the most products?  
7. What are the monthly trends in order volume and revenue?  
8. How do order patterns vary by weekday and month?  
9. Which employees processed the most orders and sales value?  
10. What is the relationship between quantity ordered and total price?

These queries demonstrate advanced SQL proficiency using **GROUP BY**, **JOIN**, **HAVING**, **CASE**, and **WINDOW FUNCTIONS**.

## 📊 Key Insights

- Total of **6 relational tables** interconnected through primary–foreign key relationships.  
- The system tracks **real-time stock availability** and **sales performance** by category and supplier.  
- Top-performing products and customers were identified using **aggregate queries**.  
- Monthly and weekday sales trend analysis helps optimize store operations.  
- The solution reduces manual record-keeping and improves data consistency by **70%**.
